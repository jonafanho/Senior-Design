# Vertical Automated Storage Technology
An engineering capstone project at [Seattle Pacific University](https://spu.edu/).

## About the Code
Written in C with PSoC Creator. Used with the PSoC prototyping kit.

The Colour LCD Shield library isn't used, but it is left in there for backwards compatibility.

Parts of the code to drive the RA8875 LCD screen is taken from this [Arduino library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_RA8875).

## About the Project
### The Problem
* People who are physically handicapped have a limited ability to lift and store items at out of reach heights.
* The Americans with Disabilities Act requires a maximum reach height of 120cm (48"), and a minimum reach height of 38cm (15").
* There is a need in the community for a system that automatically stores items well above and below these restrictions.

### Our Solution
* At the press of a button, the Vertical Automated Storage System (VAST) will automatically retrieve or store a bin with items at heights of up to 210cm (7') in the shelf.
* The user will have a convenient user access area at a height that is comfortable for them.

### The Approach
* A ceiling height shelving unit that utilizes vertical space.
* Automatic bin retrieval system using precise motors to enable three axis motion.
* Maximum lifting capability of 18kg (40lb) per bin.
* User interface complete with touch buttons and a screen.
* Focus on user safety through the use of infrared sensors and an anti-entanglement housing.
